# api_containers
dummy API architecture to play with docker / k8s etc...

to include:
- test fastAPI
- think about logging etc...
- utilise pydantic to validate inputs as apparently it works very well with fastapi
- attempt a quality architecture rather than some shitty script but you know how these things go
